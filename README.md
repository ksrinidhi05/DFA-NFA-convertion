# NFA to DFA Conversion Algorithm
This code implements an algorithm to convert a Non-deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA) into a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) by iterating through DFA states and defining transitions for each input symbol. The code uses a subset construction technique, where each state in the DFA corresponds to a subset of states in the NFA.

## Detailed Code Flow:
### 1. Iterate Over Each DFA State (q):
    q is the set of states that the algorithm has processed or needs to process in the DFA. Each element of q represents a state in the DFA, which is a subset of states in the original NFA.

### 2.Process Each Symbol in the DFA Alphabet (dfa_letters):
    For each state in q, the algorithm iterates through each symbol in the alphabet to determine the transitions.

### 3.Direct Transitions for Single-State Subsets:
    If the current DFA state (in_state) consists of a single NFA state and a valid transition exists in the NFA for the given symbol:

    The DFA transition is directly set to the destination state defined by the NFA.

    If the destination state is not already in the set of DFA states (q), it’s added for further processing.

### 4.Handling Composite (Multi-State) Transitions:
    If in_state is a composite state (subset of multiple NFA states), or there’s no direct transition for a single-state subset:

    The algorithm collects all reachable states from each NFA state within in_state for the current symbol, aggregating results without duplicates.

    Two lists are used:
      dest: Holds intermediate destination states as they are discovered.
      f_dest: Holds the final set of unique destination states.

### 5.Build the DFA Transition:
    The unique set of destination states (f_dest) is assigned as the DFA transition for the current state-symbol pair.
    If f_dest represents a new DFA state (not already in q), it’s added to q to ensure all necessary states are processed.

### 6.DFA Transition Table (dfa_transitions):
    The result of each state-symbol transition is stored in dfa_transitions. This dictionary maps each DFA state-symbol pair to its corresponding destination state(s), effectively building the DFA transition table.

## Key Points:

    Subset Construction: The DFA states are subsets of NFA states, where each subset represents a possible combination of NFA states that can be reached simultaneously.
    
    State Deduplication: To ensure minimal state representation, duplicates are removed from destination states in f_dest.
    
    Incremental State Addition: Newly discovered states are appended to q to explore further transitions, which guarantees that the entire DFA is constructed by the end of the loop.
